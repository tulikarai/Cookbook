Ingredients
Fresh Roma tomatoes – use the nice and red ones, avoid anything soft.
Canned tomatoes – I like to use canned in addition to fresh because it gives the salsa a better consistency.
Fresh cilantro – cilantro adds key flavor, don’t omit this!
Jalapeno – this adds a nice kick. If you don’t like heat you can replace it with 1/4 cup chopped bell pepper, or omit.
Red onion – yellow onion can be used here as well.
Green onion – if you don’t want to buy both kinds of onions you can omit the green onions and add just a little more red onion.
Garlic – it may seem small but garlic packs a flavorful punch. Only use fresh garlic here for best flavor.
Lime – this really brightens up the salsa.
Chili powder and cumin – I don’t always add these but they’re a nice addition if you have them on hand.
Sugar – just a touch balances out the acidity of the tomatoes and lime.
Salt and pepper – the salsa would taste flat without the salt and the pepper adds a light kick.


Onion and tomatoes and potatoes and other vegetables.
